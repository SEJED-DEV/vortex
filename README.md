# Vortex Manager 🌪️
> **The Intelligent Core of Your Discord Community.**

Vortex is a state-of-the-art, AI-driven Discord management engine designed for high-security, autonomous, and professional community oversight. Built on a multi-model fallback architecture, Vortex transforms your server into a self-regulating ecosystem.

## 🚀 Advanced Capabilities

### 🧠 Free-Tier "No Paywall" Architecture
Vortex is configured to use industry-leading free APIs, bypassing expensive token limits:
- **Lightning LLMs**: Powered by **Groq** (Llama 3.3) and **Gemini API** for ultra-fast, free reasoning.
- **Limitless Web Search**: Uses **DuckDuckGo** scrapers instead of paid APIs to fetch live internet data instantly.
- **Infinite Image Generation**: Uses **Pollinations.ai** to generate stunning images without an API key.

### 📚 Omniscient Logging & Memory
Vortex literally *never forgets*. 
- **Console-to-File Hook**: Every single terminal output, diagnostic error, and AI thought process is automatically mirrored to `data/logs/console.log` in real-time.
- **Persistent User Profiles**: Every interaction is permanently logged to `data/users/<userId>.json`.
- **Premium Visual Audit**: System logs in `ai-actions-logs` feature a "Sapphire-grade" UI with dynamic coloring and rich metadata.

### 🛡️ Advanced Moderation & Security
Professional-grade tools for community safety.
- **Autonomous Self-Moderation**: Vortex is authorized to enforce its own authority. If a user is disrespectful, the engine can autonomously issue warnings and timeouts.
- **Security Auditor**: Scans roles for dangerous permissions, detects exposed webhooks, and checks MFA levels.
- **Native Timeouts & Warnings**: AI-driven muting and warning system with automatic DM notifications to targets.
- **Softbans & Purges**: Instantly clear chat history while removing bad actors.

### 🧩 Available Skills (Commands)
Vortex responds natively to conversational requests using these underlying modules:
- `vortexXP` — View your leveling Rank Card, XP multipliers, or the Server Leaderboard.
- `createPoll` — Create interactive, button-based polls with live vote counting.
- `generateImage` — Generate artwork from text using Pollinations.ai.
- `webSearch` — Search the live web using DuckDuckGo.
- `serverStats` — Generate an embed showing population growth, VC engagement, and server health.
- `autoResponder` — Add regex-supported chat triggers with randomized responses (Staff Only).
- `githubPulse` — Track live GitHub repository commits/PRs (Admin Only).
- `securityAudit` — Run a deep vulnerability scan on the server (Admin Only).

### 🛠️ Self-Evolution & Integrity
- **Autonomous Patching**: The bot can read, debug, and upgrade its own source code via the `evolve` skill.
- **Integrity Shields**: Constant monitoring for external file modifications with AI-driven security alerts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Vortex is built with a focus on performance, modularity, and scalability. It uses a **Modular Service-Oriented Architecture**:

- **`src/core/`**: Central bot logic, client management, logging, and constants.
- **`src/services/`**: High-level business logic like `PromptService` (AI orchestration) and `VisionService` (image analysis).
- **`src/events/`**: Decoupled Discord event handlers for better maintainability.
- **`src/providers/`**: Manages multi-model rotation and AI provider fallbacks.
- **`src/skills/`**: Dynamically loaded feature modules (commands, tools).
- **`src/utils/`**: Shared utilities for server management, sessions, and integrity checks.

Vortex is inspired by modern architectural patterns and utilizes a **Modular Handler Pattern** to ensure each component remains focused and testable.
